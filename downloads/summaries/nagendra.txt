# ModelFuzz: Model guided fuzzing of distributed systems
## Srinidhi Nagendra, Max Planck Institute for Software Systems

This presentation introduces ModelFuzz, a novel approach that combines formal methods with fuzzing techniques to test distributed systems. The approach uses TLA+ models to guide the fuzzing process, allowing for more efficient exploration of the state space and better detection of subtle concurrency bugs and protocol violations.

Key aspects of the presentation:
1. The challenges of testing distributed systems
2. Current limitations of traditional fuzzing techniques
3. How TLA+ models can guide the fuzzing process
4. Implementation details of the ModelFuzz tool
5. Case studies and evaluation results
6. Future directions and potential applications

This innovative approach bridges the gap between formal verification and dynamic testing, showing how formal specifications can enhance testing techniques beyond their traditional use in verification.
