# Automating Trace Validation with PGo
## Finn Hackett & Ivan Beschastnikh, University of British Columbia

This presentation discusses PGo, a tool for generating executable Go code from PlusCal and TLA+ specifications. The focus is on the automated trace validation features that allow developers to verify that system logs and execution traces conform to the formal specification, providing a powerful bridge between specification and implementation.

Key aspects of the presentation:
1. Introduction to PGo and its capabilities
2. Challenges of bridging formal specifications and implementations
3. Approach to trace validation and runtime verification
4. Implementation details of the trace validation system
5. Case studies showing how PGo detects specification violations in execution traces
6. Performance considerations and optimizations
7. Future work and extensions

The talk demonstrates how formal specifications can be leveraged beyond design-time verification to provide runtime validation of actual system executions, enhancing confidence in both the specification and implementation.
