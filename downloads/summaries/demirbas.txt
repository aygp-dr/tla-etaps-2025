# TLA+ Modeling of MongoDB Transactions
## Murat Demirbas & Will Schultz, MongoDB

This presentation details MongoDB's use of TLA+ for modeling and verifying distributed database transactions. The speakers discuss how formal specification helped uncover subtle bugs in transaction protocols and guided the design of MongoDB's transaction implementation.

Key aspects of the presentation:
1. Introduction to MongoDB's distributed architecture and transaction requirements
2. Challenges in designing distributed transactions with specific isolation guarantees
3. TLA+ modeling approach for MongoDB transactions
4. How formal specification influenced the design process
5. Specific bugs and edge cases discovered through model checking
6. Integration of TLA+ into MongoDB's engineering workflow
7. Lessons learned and best practices for applying TLA+ in industry
8. Evolution of the specification alongside the implementation

The presentation provides a real-world industrial case study of applying formal methods to a complex distributed system, showing how TLA+ can be an integral part of the design and implementation process for critical database features like transactions.
