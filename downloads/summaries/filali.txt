# Formal models for monotonic pipeline architectures
## J.-P. Bodeveix, A. Bonenfant, T. Carle, M. Filali, C. Rochange

This talk explores the application of formal methods to verify properties of monotonic pipeline architectures in computing systems. The presenters show how TLA+ specifications can model and verify timing behavior and correctness of pipeline designs, with particular focus on real-time embedded systems.

Key aspects of the presentation:
1. Introduction to monotonic pipeline architectures and their properties
2. Challenges in verifying timing behavior in real-time systems
3. TLA+ modeling approach for pipeline architectures
4. Expressing and verifying temporal properties
5. Case studies from real-time embedded systems
6. Performance analysis and WCET (Worst-Case Execution Time) guarantees
7. Integration with existing embedded system design workflows
8. Comparison with other formal approaches for timing verification

The presentation demonstrates how TLA+ can be applied beyond traditional distributed systems verification to address challenges in real-time computing and hardware/software interface verification, expanding the domain of application for formal methods.
